- The Stopwatch component contains the state variables to store the elapsed time and control the stopwatch. It utilizes useState, useEffect, and useRef hooks as follows:

- useState: Used to manage the state of the stopwatch, including the elapsed time and whether it is running or stopped.
- useEffect: Used to start and stop the stopwatch timer when the component mounts and unmounts, and to update the elapsed time every millisecond.
- useRef: Used to hold references to the interval ID to enable starting and stopping the timer.

# Features
- Start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.
- Display elapsed time in  minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
